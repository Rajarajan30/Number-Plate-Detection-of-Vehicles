# Number-Plate-Detection-of-Vehicles & OCR

A real-time Number Plate Detection and OCR system using YOLO for detection and EasyOCR/Tesseract for text extraction, wrapped in a Streamlit web app.

## The primary goals of this system include: 

- Detecting number plates from images of vehicles captured in different 
environments and lighting conditions. 
- Extracting number plate regions accurately while handling challenges like 
occlusions, varying backgrounds, and different plate formats. 
- Applying Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to extract the alphanumeric text 
from the detected plates. 
- Deploying the system as a user-friendly web application for real-time processing.
